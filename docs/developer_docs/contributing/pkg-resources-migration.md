# pkg_resources Deprecation and Migration Guide

## Background

As of setuptools 81.0.0, the `pkg_resources` API is deprecated and will be removed. This affects several packages in the Python ecosystem.

## Current Status

### Superset Codebase

The Superset codebase has fully migrated away from `pkg_resources` to the modern `importlib.metadata` API:

- `superset/db_engine_specs/__init__.py` - Uses `from importlib.metadata import entry_points`
- All entry point loading uses the modern API
- The `setuptools<81` version pin has been removed since Superset no longer depends on `pkg_resources` at runtime

### Production Dependencies

Some third-party dependencies may still use `pkg_resources`. If you encounter issues with setuptools >= 81, check your dependency tree for packages that haven't migrated yet and pin them individually.

## Migration Example

**Old (deprecated):**
```python
import pkg_resources

version = pkg_resources.get_distribution("package_name").version
entry_points = pkg_resources.iter_entry_points("group_name")
```

**New (recommended):**
```python
from importlib.metadata import version, entry_points

pkg_version = version("package_name")
eps = entry_points(group="group_name")
```

## For Extension Developers

1. **Update your packages** to use `importlib.metadata` instead of `pkg_resources`
2. **Test with setuptools >= 81.0.0** to ensure compatibility
